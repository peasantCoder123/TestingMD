## 🧭 Guiding thoughts

Here's where you can offer your new hire advice for their first 90 days. We've included some favorite tips from Atlassians below, which you can add to, edit, or replace with your own guidance.
 - **Take time to learn.** Don't get sucked into the minutia of decision-making or project involvement too early - there will be plenty of time for that later. In your first 30 days, try to focus on getting comfortable and learning how things work.
 - **Invest in relationships.** By day 60, you'll be in execution mode. In your first two months, spend as much time as you can getting to know people and forming relationships.
 - **Don't be afraid to ask.** No one expects you to know how things at < Company > work right away. Take advantage of that and ask for help when you need it.
